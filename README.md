## Structure

The structure of the repository is shown below:

```shell

```

## Instances

The instances in the **``instances/existing``** folder are existing instances created by **[LÃ³pez and Beasley (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054818300509)** and **[Bouzid and
Salhi (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221720302149)**. The instances in the **``instances/new``** folder is newly dataset generated by us.

## Results

Folders **``results/CBPP-RI``** and **``results/SCPP-RI``** provide detailed results obtained by the GDILS for solving CBPP-RI and SCPP-RI, respectively. We have mentioned below something about the meaning of some columns in **``csv``** files:
